# Hashtables

Hashtable is data structure which store data as key value pairs.

## Challenge

to build hashtable class and define add, get and contains methods for it

## Approach & Efficiency

hash:

- time O(n)
- space O(1)

## API

- hash: method returns Index in the collection for that key

- add: method that hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.

- find: method returns Value associated with that key in the table.

- contains: method returns Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
