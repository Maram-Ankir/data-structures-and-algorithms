# Stacks and Queues

* Stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
Queue is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.



## Challenge

Creating stack and queue classes
for the stack I added push, pop, peek and is empty methods.
and for the queue enqueue, dequeue, peek and is empty methods.

## Approach & Efficiency

The time complexity and space for all stack and queue methods is O(1)

## API

### stack:

- push: add values to the top of stack
- pop:remove values from top of stack
- peek: return value of top
- isempty:return true if stack is empty

### queue:

- enqueue: add values to the rear of queue
- dequeue: remove values from front of queue
- peek: return value of front
- isempty: return true if stack is empty
